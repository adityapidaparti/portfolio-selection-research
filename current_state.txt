Current bug issues:

Right now, running both MATLAB and Python for Days 1-2/2-3.

W-update:
Weird things are happening. The w_temp values from MATLAB do NOT match the
w_temp values from Python. Instead, the Python w_temp vectors match the
w vectors from MATLAB, and the find_y function in Python appears to do nothing.
This is still all within the floating point error range.
TODO: Look into how/why w_temp malfunctions, but in an ok way.

Z-update:
Values are slightly off, but in the correct spot. Chalking it up to floating point
errors currently.

U-update:
U-update working properly, once accounting for floating point errors

Iterations:
Iterations are fine. Due to floating point errors, not exactly the same

Current modifications:

Code fails on day 1120 for the case displayed. In 95% of cases, it appears to
run properly, which is concerning. However, this instance fails.
Current process involves throwing errors to see what is happening around that
time-period in both the MATLAB and the Python code.

TODO: Step through the days to see where errors are occurring around day 1119.
USE THE ETA AND ALPHA SPECIFIED BY E AND A

NOTE: MATLAB code is 1 day 'ahead', as in day 120 in MATLAB corresponds to day 119
in Python.
