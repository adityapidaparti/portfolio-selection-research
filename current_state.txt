Current bug issues:

Right now, running both MATLAB and Python for Days 1-2/2-3.

W-update:
Weird things are happening. The w_temp values from MATLAB do NOT match the
w_temp values from Python. Instead, the Python w_temp vectors match the
w vectors from MATLAB, and the find_y function in Python appears to do nothing.
This is still all within the floating point error range. Very confusing.

Z-update:
Values are slightly off, but in the correct spot. Chalking it up to floating point
errors currently.

U-update:
U-update working properly, once accounting for floating point errors

Iterations:
Not enough iterations through currently.

Current prints are
  Python:

  MATLAB:
